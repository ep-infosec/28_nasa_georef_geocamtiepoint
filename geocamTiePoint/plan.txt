/ember#/align/id - loads user image, puts tie points where user specified in the base layer,
	      	   make live affine projection with them, dragging should also work to update
	      	   the affine projection.

/ember#/place/id - same as above, but lets user place tie points on image before aligning them
		   to the actual google map
